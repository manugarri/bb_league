                <p>
                    Blood Bowl is a fantasy football board game created by Games Workshop. 
                    It combines American football with the fantasy races of the Warhammer universe, 
                    resulting in a brutal, tactical, and hilarious game where Orcs, Elves, Humans, 
                    and other races clash on the gridiron.
